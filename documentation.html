            The Vindicator is currently on version 0.1. New realeses are undefined and uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vindicator Mathematical Language is a language design with prefix notation, meant to be used only for mathematical operations. It's not a programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vindicator accepts two data type: Number and Vector. Those two don't operate together (yet).<br>
            Both can be operated on two different types of operations: Unary and Binary. Unary accepts only 1 argumento, Binary expects 2.<br>
            For vectors, unary operations are applied element-wise, creating a new vector. While binary operations are executed on every pair of elements, from first to last, returning a single element as a result.<br>
            Operations on vectors are the same as on numbers, but are identified with a '$' at the front.
        </p>
        -----------------------------------------
        <p>
            # Numerical Examples <br>
            1. Unary Operation => sqrt 9 <br>
            2. Binary Operation => + 1 2 <br>
            3. Setting variable => set nice 69 <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            # Vector Examples <br>
            1. Setting vector => vec nums 10 11 12 13 <br>
            2. Binary Operation => $+ nums <br>
            3. Unary Operation => $sqrt nums <br>
        </p>
        ------------------------------------------

            >> Operations Available: <br>
            [Unary]: sqrt, abs, ceil, floor, exp, print <br>
            [Binary]: +, -, *, /, %, pow, log <br>
